# How to get started using MetaMask (Desktop Edition)

MetaMask has risen to the de facto crypto wallet to traverse through the DeFi landscape. 30 million users worldwide, at the time of this article, and that number keeps climbing.

What's the hype?

Here's a **Get Started Guide** on how to jump into Decentralized Finance with MetaMask.

## Crypto Wallet 101

Welcome to DeFi! I HIGHLY recommend reading [this article]() if you are completely new to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. It will get you caught up quickly on how it all works and the "lingo" associated to keep your link-clicking to a minimum. 

Let's get started!

## Step 1: Let's head to the official MetaMask website:

https://metamask.io/

‚ùóÔ∏èNote - Get into the habit of hovering over your links before you click them. I'll explain why later in this guide.

## Step 2: Choose your Browser!

- You can choose from the following:
  - Chrome (_recommended_)
  - FireFox
  - Brave
  - Edge
- Your browser will then direct you to their "web store" to download the extension. (Example pictures will be shown in the Chrome browser)

## Step 3: Run through the Set-Up

- Select **Create a Wallet**

## Step 4: Create a Password

- This will be used to unlock your MetaMask wallet. It is different than your Secret Recovery Phrase which we will go over shortly.

## Step 5: Learn about Securing your Wallet

- The team at MetaMask has put together a great 90 second clip that highlights the key points about your Secret Recovery Phrase. This is a _must_ watch.

## Step 6: Secret Recovery Phrase

- This is where you'll need a pen and paper (or metal plate if you're hardcore) to store your Secret Recovery Phrase offline out of reach of hackers.
  ‚ùóÔ∏è**_Note_** - You may see Secret Recovery Phrase called "seed phrase" in the wild. This is the original term but was recently changed in order to reduce confusion amongst new users.

## Step 7: Confirm Secret Recovery Phrase

- Then you'll confirm your Secret Recovery Phrase by entering it.
