Welcome to DeFi! I HIGHLY recommend reading [this article]() if you are completely new to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. It will get you caught up quickly on how it all works and the "lingo" associated to keep your link-clicking to a minimum. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Let's head to the official MetaMask website:

‚ùóÔ∏èNote - Get into the habit of hovering over your links before you click them. I'll explain why later in this guide.

## Step 2: Choose your Browser!

- You can choose from the following:
  - Chrome (_recommended_)
  - FireFox
  - Brave
  - Edge
- Your browser will then direct you to their "web store" to download the extension. (Example pictures will be shown in the Chrome browser)

## Step 4: Create a Password

## Step 5: Learn about Securing your Wallet

- The team at MetaMask has put together a great 90 second clip that highlights the key points about your Secret Recovery Phrase. This is a _must_ watch.

## Step 6: Secret Recovery Phrase

- This is where you'll need a pen and paper (or metal plate if you're hardcore) to store your Secret Recovery Phrase offline out of reach of hackers.
  ‚ùóÔ∏è**_Note_** - You may see Secret Recovery Phrase called "seed phrase" in the wild. This is the original term but was recently changed in order to reduce confusion amongst new users.
