## Crypto Wallet 101

Welcome to DeFi! I HIGHLY recommend reading [this article](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489611) if you are completely new to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. It will get you caught up quickly on how it all works and the "lingo" associated to keep your link-clicking to a minimum. 

MetaMask has risen to the most popular crypto wallet to traverse through the DeFi ([Decentralized Finance](https://blog.coinbase.com/a-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-finance-defi-574c68ff43c4)) landscape. 30 million users worldwide, at the time of this article, and that number keeps climbing. All EVM ([_Ethereum Virtual Machine_](https://moralis.io/evm-explained-what-is-ethereum-virtual-machine/)) DeFi protocols make sure they support MetaMask wallets first and foremost so you'll be set up for success.

Let's get started!
<br>
<br>
## Step 1: Official MetaMask Website

![metamask-home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17716182/173207762-1c1f118c-d98a-4f9e-8bf4-e2826bf0d083.png)

- https://metamask.io/

‚ùóÔ∏èNote - Get into the habit of hovering over your links before you click them. I'll explain why later in this guide.
<br>
<br>
## Step 2: Choose your Browser!

![metamask-browser-install](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17716182/173207784-9aea1c1f-4bd9-4a8e-b11c-d927a4a1753b.png)

- You can choose from the following:
  - Chrome (_recommended_)
  - FireFox
  - Brave
  - Edge
- Your browser will then direct you to their "web store" to download the extension. (Example pictures will be shown in the Chrome browser)

![chrome-web-store](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17716182/173207996-306f379f-fee9-4547-937d-e4f6a0de7a3a.png)
<br>
<br>
## Step 3: Run through the Set-Up

- Select **Create a Wallet**

![metamask-new-wallet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17716182/173207807-3b03ad08-84a7-40f3-b335-df2ddddeae17.png)

## Step 4: Create a Password

- This will be used to unlock your MetaMask wallet. It is different than your Secret Recovery Phrase which we will go over shortly.

<br>
## Step 5: Learn about Securing your Wallet

- The team at MetaMask has put together a great 90 second clip that highlights the key points about your Secret Recovery Phrase. This is a _must_ watch.

<br>
<br>
## Step 6: Secret Recovery Phrase

- This is where you'll need a pen and paper (or metal plate if you're hardcore) to store your Secret Recovery Phrase offline out of reach of hackers.
  ‚ùóÔ∏è**_Note_** - You may see Secret Recovery Phrase called "seed phrase" in the wild. This is the original term but was recently changed in order to reduce confusion amongst new users.

<br>
<br>
## Step 7: Confirm Secret Recovery Phrase

- Then you'll confirm your Secret Recovery Phrase by entering it.

<br>
<br>
## Step 8: You're done! ü•≥

Let's go over the UI (User Interface) so you know what to expect.
<br>
<br>
## UI Walkthrough

* Click on the MetaMask tab and it will prompt you for your password you created in [Step 4](#step-4-create-a-password). You'll then be taken to your wallet's "homepage".

![2022-06-13_10-40-05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17716182/173393351-ed2c11f1-729d-4ede-bd5e-f9f790064bcb.png)

1. **Current Network:** Tells you which network (blockchain) you are connected to.
2. **Account List:** Displays your accounts and allows you to create more accounts (wallets) or import your existing wallets.
3. **Current Account:** Displays your current account. You can copy your account to your computer's clipboard by clicking here.
4. **Website Connection:** Shows if your wallet is connected to the current website you're on.
5. **Account Details:** This will give you a dropdown menu to view your account on Etherscan, display your full account address, and manage your connected sites.
6. **Token Display:** This defaults to the amount you have of the main token used to pay for transactions (This will always be ETH if you're on the Ethereum Network).
7. **Buy, Sell & Swap:** 
  - _**Buy**_ will connect you to MetaMask's third-party partners to allow you to purchase ETH directly without having to go through an exchange.
  - _**Send**_ will allow you to send your tokens to another wallet
  - _**Swap**_ will give you the option to exchange your tokens for other tokens without having to interact with an exchange directly as well.
8. _**Assets & Activity:**_
  - _**Assets**_ displays all the tokens currently in your wallet and their equivalent fiat value.
  - _**Activity**_ shows all interactions/transactions made with the current network.

## Key Tips
Navigating DeFi can be a little overwhelming at first but it gets easier the more you use it. Here are a few things to remember to keep your experience a good one and to keep your funds safe.

#### _NEVER_ share your Secret Recovery Phrase.
- I really mean this. _**NEVER!**_ Unless you are recovering your wallet on the **Official MetaMask Application** under no circumstances will you ever need to share this information. If a website is asking for it, _**DO NOT**_ connect to it. It is 100% a phishing scam to steal your tokens.

#### Hover over links before you click on them.
- It's an extra security step but it really does help especially if you are using a website link for the first time. For new protocols, I like to search for their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) handle first and then click their direct link. This will ensure you are not going to a malicious copy of the protocol you want to use. Hovering over the link you'll see a pop-up next to your cursor and you can evaluate if the URL is indeed the correct one.

#### Use Bookmarks.
- This will save you from relying on the above steps for the protocols you use the most and you can easily identify if something is "phishy".

#### Test your transactions with a small amount first.
- If you are sending tokens with the send function or making a swap, use a small amount of the token first to test. If your sending address is incorrect for any reason, you'll lose the funds permanently. You'll pay a little extra for the added transaction fee but it's a small price to pay if your sending large amounts across the network.

That's all folks! I hope this guide helps ease you into the world of DeFi!

Have fun and be safe! ‚úåÔ∏è
